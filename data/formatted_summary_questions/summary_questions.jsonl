In order to test this hypothesis, we have fed the autoencoder with data whose nature is very different from the temperature maps it has been trained on: the CAMELS logo...In this case, we find that around 30% of the images have a good reconstruction loss, while 70% of them have much larger reconstructed errors than anything produced for the temperature maps."}

The stellar metallicity and stellar radius are also among the five most important features in both cases. However, for IllustrisTNG galaxies, the K-band is very important, while in the case of SIMBA galaxies, R_{max}, is selected as an important feature.

The stellar metallicity and stellar radius are also among the five most important features in both cases. However, for IllustrisTNG galaxies, the K-band seems a very relevant property (this property is not present in the SIMBA galaxies) while in the case of SIMBA galaxies the radius associated to the maximum circular velocity, R_{max}, is selected as an important feature."}
{"question": "In the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" paper, why are the trained models not robust?", "ideal": "Plotting the data from the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations in a lower dimensional space, where the most important properties are considered, reveals that the two simulations populate the parameter space differently, depending on \\Omega_m. According to the authors, this is why the models are not robust, as this indicates that \\Omega_m induces an effect on galaxy properties", "citations": "p12; sec4.3, p13;sec4.4", "key_passage": "From Fig. 7 we can also see the large, intrinsic differences between the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG galaxies: while they exhibit similar qualitative dependence with \\Omega_m, they populate the parameter space differently. This is however expected, given the large differences between the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA subgrid models. We note that in higher dimensions, the differences between the simulations may be even more pronounced. We believe that this is the reason why our models are not robust; i.e. a model trained on galaxy properties from IllustrisTNG simulations does not work when tested on SIMBA galaxies, and the other way around....This indicates that \\Omega_m  induces an effect on galaxy properties, or on a subset of them, that cannot be mimicked by astrophysical effects"}
{"question": "In the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" paper, why does \\Omega_m change the placement of the galaxy in parameter space?", "ideal": "The authors interpret these results as \\Omega_m changing the manifold where galaxy properties reside, indicating that \\Omega_m  induces an effect on galaxy properties that cannot be mimicked by astrophysical effects.", "citations": "p12; Fig7, p13; sec4.4", "key_passage": "We interpret these results as \\Omega_m changing the manifold where galaxy properties reside in a different way as feedback does...This indicates that \\Omega_m  induces an effect on galaxy properties, or on a subset of them, that cannot be mimicked by astrophysical effects...Thus, we may think that \\Omega_m may change the manifold where galaxy properties live, and that change is different to the one induced by changes in feedback."}

This is the same trend is found with \\Omega_m, indicating that larger values of \\Omega_m will tend to increase the dark matter content of galaxies. Thus, according to the authors, \\Omega_m increases the dark matter content of the galaxies, which, in turn, increases the value of V_{max} for fixed stellar masses.", "citations": "p14; sec4.6", "key_passage": "We have taken the 100 galaxies for 100 different models that we discussed above and plot in Fig. 8 the V_{max} versus M_* projection for those galaxies...As can be seen, for a fixed value of the stellar mass, the larger the dark matter mass the higher the value of V_{max}...This is the same trend we find with \\Omega_m (top panels), indicating that larger values of \\Omega_m will tend to increase the dark matter content of galaxies."}

From these tests we conclude that the network may be using information either about the dark matter content of the galaxy or about its gravitational potential well."}

{"question": "In the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?", "ideal": "V_{max} contains more information than M_t and \\sigma_{\\nu}, which are other properties that are expected to be heavily affected by dark matter. The authors believe that is because it is known that V_{max} correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass, thus the value of V_{max} may remain rather stable since it mostly probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, that are the least affected by processes like tidal forces.", "citations": "p14; sec4.6", "key_passage": "This clearly indicates that V_{max} contains more information than M_t and \\sigma_{\\nu}. We believe that this may be happening because it is known that V_{max} correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass (Conroy et al. 2006). For instance, when halos are accreted into larger halos they may lose a significant fraction of their dark matter content due to tidal forces. That effect will change the dark matter content of galaxies significantly, but the value of V_{max} may remain rather stable since it mostly probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, that are the least affected by the above processes."}
{"question": "In the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" paper, are numerical artifacts present in the results of the inference of \\Omega_m?", "ideal": "The authors do not refute the possibility of numerical artifacts that can be learned by the neural network, but they also cannot come up with a process that could give rise to such a numerical artifact.", "citations": "p18; sec5.3", "key_passage": "Thus, while we could not identify a process that will give rise to a numerical artifact that can be learned by the machine learning models, we cannot completely discard that possibility here."}
{"question": "In the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" paper, what would be the expected consequences if the authors' conclusions are correct?", "ideal": "If the conclusions given in the \"Cosmology with one galaxy?\" are correct, it implies that it should be difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce the galaxy properties from real galaxies for cosmologies with a value of \\Omega_m far away from the true one.
