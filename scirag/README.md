# SciRAG: Scientific Retrieval-Augmented Generation Research Project

A comprehensive research framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems on scientific literature, with particular focus on cosmology and astrophysics papers. This project compares multiple RAG approaches including traditional PDF processing, OCR-enhanced text extraction, and various AI platforms.

##  Research Overview

This project investigates the effectiveness of different RAG methodologies for scientific question answering, comparing traditional approaches with OCR-processed text extraction across multiple AI platforms including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Vertex AI, and PaperQA2.

### Key Research Questions
- How does OCR-enhanced text extraction compare to traditional PDF processing in RAG systems?
- Which AI platform provides the most accurate scientific question answering?
- What are the trade-offs between cost, accuracy, and response quality across different approaches?
- How do different chunk sizes and embedding models affect retrieval performance?
