    "question": "What effect does bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned media have on the expression of the CD8a receptor in cultured OT-1 T cells?",
    "choices": [
      "(A) No effect",
      "(B) Insufficient information to answer the question",
      "(C) Decrease",
      "(D) Increase"
    ],
    "response": "Bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned media (SCM) does not significantly alter the expression of the CD8\u03b1 receptor in cultured OT-1 T cells. Studies indicate that when OT-1 T cells were cultured in SCM, there were no significant changes in the surface expression of the CD8\u03b1 co-receptor compared to unconditioned medium (UCM) or adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) after 24 hours. Statistical analysis confirmed that the differences in CD8\u03b1 expression levels among these conditions were not significant, with P-values indicating a lack of effect (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 3-5, 5-6).\n\nWhile SCM does not negatively impact CD8\u03b1 expression, there is a noted trend towards increased surface expression of CD8\u03b1 in ACM, suggesting a potential enhancing effect of ACM on CD8\u03b1 levels (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 5-6). Overall, the data imply that SCM maintains CD8\u03b1 expression without inducing significant alterations (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 2-3). Therefore, the correct answer to the questio...",
