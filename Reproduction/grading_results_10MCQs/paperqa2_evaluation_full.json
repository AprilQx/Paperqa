      "response": "DiffDomain classifies approximately 30.771% of topologically associated domains (TADs) in the GM12878 blood cell line as reorganized in the K562 cell line. This percentage is significantly higher compared to other methods such as TADCompare, HiCcompare, and HiC-DC+, which identify reorganized TADs at rates of \u22648.256% (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-4). Additionally, DiffDomain demonstrates a higher true positive rate (TPR) and stronger statistical evidence in identifying reorganized TADs compared to alternative approaches (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-5). \n\nWhile other excerpts mention that DiffDomain identifies 51.534% of TADs as reorganized between GM12878 and K562, this figure likely refers to a broader analysis of TAD reorganization rather than the specific classification of GM12878 TADs in K562 (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 3-4). Therefore, the most accurate percentage for GM12878 TADs classified as reorganized in K562 is 30.771%.",

      "response": "Two hours after budding yeast enter meiosis, the expression level of Swi4 decreases by approximately 30% in wild-type cells. This reduction is critical for proper meiotic progression, as it ensures the downregulation of SBF-specific target genes, such as *CLN1* and *CLN2*, which are necessary for the transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate (su2023combinedtranscranialmagnetic pages 4-4; su2023combinedtranscranialmagnetic pages 2-4). The decrease in Swi4 levels is mediated by the induction of *SWI4LUTI* expression by the Ime1-Ume6 complex, which causes transcriptional and translational interference, leading to reduced Swi4 protein production. This has been confirmed through smFISH data, RNA blot analyses, and statistical tests showing significant differences in transcript levels between premeiotic and meiotic cells (su2023combinedtranscranialmagnetic pages 12-13).\n\nIn contrast, in the pATG8-SWI4 strain, Swi4 levels are elevated compared to wild type at the same time point.

This trend is observed across various embryonic and somatic cell types, including embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and liver tissue. However, in specific brain regions such as the midbrain and hippocampus, no significant difference in m6A enrichment between X-linked and autosomal transcripts is noted. The reduced m6A levels on X-linked transcripts are attributed to their evolution to harbor fewer m6A motifs, which may contribute to their higher stability compared to autosomal transcripts. This differential m6A enrichment is thought to play a role in balancing X-to-autosome gene expression dosage during development, particularly through transcript stabilization (naik2024roleofm6a pages 3-4; naik2024roleofm6a pages 6-7; naik2024roleofm6a pages 2-3).\n\nThe study also highlights that m6A RNA methylation has ...",
