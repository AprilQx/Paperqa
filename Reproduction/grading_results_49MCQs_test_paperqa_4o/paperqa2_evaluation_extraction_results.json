    "response": "Depletion of STX17 and SNAP29 expression in LN229 cells, a glioblastoma cell line, leads to an increase in the formation of retraction fibers and migrasomes. This effect is attributed to the inhibition of autophagosome/lysosome fusion caused by the absence of these SNARE proteins. Experimental observations demonstrated that knockdown of STX17 and SNAP29 using siRNA disrupted the autophagic flux, resulting in elevated migrasome production. Additionally, autophagosomes were observed within migrasomes under these conditions, further supporting the role of these proteins in maintaining normal autophagic processes (lee2024migrasomalautophagosomesrelieve pages 5-6; lee2024migrasomalautophagosomesrelieve pages 6-7).\n\nThese findings suggest that the depletion of STX17 and SNAP29 promotes the generation of retraction fibers and migrasomes by impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes.

    ],
    "response": "When HIF-1 nuclear translocation is induced in fibroblasts, lysyl oxidase (LOX) secretion increases. This effect has been demonstrated using Cobalt(II)-chloride (CoCl2), which stabilizes HIF-1 by preventing its degradation. CoCl2 treatment leads to elevated nuclear HIF-1 levels and a subsequent rise in both intracellular and secreted LOX, with a predominant increase in LOX secretion into the extracellular environment. Notably, intracellular LOX levels remain relatively stable, suggesting that the protein is rapidly secreted rather than accumulating within the cells. This regulatory mechanism is dependent on HIF-1, as silencing HIF-1 via siRNA prevents the CoCl2-induced upregulation of LOX secretion (balsini2024stiffnessdependentloxregulation pages 10-12; balsini2024stiffnessdependentloxregulation pages 8-10).\n\nAdditionally, substrate stiffness, which induces HIF-1 nuclear translocation, also enhances LOX secretion and enzymatic activity.

    "response": "The highest number of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) proteins observed to form an oligomer with stem\u2013loop RNA SL7 is six, organized as a hexamer of dimers. This hexameric assembly is facilitated by protein\u2013protein interactions mediated by the leucine-rich sequence (LRS) and weak cross-linking interactions between the C-terminal domain (CTD) dimers and SL7. Each N-protein dimer binds two SL7 molecules, stabilizing the hexameric structure.

    "response": "LATS2 activity regulates ALKBH5 ubiquitination by phosphorylating ALKBH5 at the S361 residue, which inhibits its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This phosphorylation event stabilizes ALKBH5 by preventing its polyubiquitination, a process that would otherwise lead to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (cao2024alats2and pages 10-10; cao2024alats2and pages 8-8). \n\nExperimental evidence demonstrates that the loss of LATS2 activity or mutation of the S361 site (e.g., the ALKBH5S361A mutant) results in increased ALKBH5 ubiquitination and reduced protein stability.

    "response": "The T6SS effector T6EC3 elicits cell rounding in *Escherichia coli* as a physiological response. This is associated with its hypothesized role as a lytic transglycosylase that targets the bacterial cell wall. Structural homology between the C-terminal domain of T6EC3 and SleB, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, supports its cell wall-targeting activity. Experimental evidence indicates that expression of T6EC3 in *E. coli* results in cell rounding, accompanied by the formation of double-membrane structures and the presence of DNA signals within the inner membrane, suggesting a disruption of cell wall integrity (geller2024identificationoftype pages 6-6, geller2024identificationoftype pages 6-7).\n\nThe activity of T6EC3 depends on a catalytic glutamate residue, as mutating this residue abolishes its toxicity, further implicating its role in cell wall degradation.

    "response": "When ZNF598 acts on the ribosomal subunit uS10 using ubiquitin with a K63R mutation, the most observed ubiquitination pattern is di-ubiquitination. This di-ubiquitination is characterized by mono-ubiquitination at two closely situated lysine residues, K4 and K8, on uS10. The K63R mutation prevents the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading ZNF598 to promote the assembly of di-ubiquitin chains with non-K63 linkages instead (miscicka2024ribosomalcollisionis pages 4-4; miscicka2024ribosomalcollisionis pages 4-5). \n\nFurther analysis revealed that in the presence of K63R ubiquitin, some tri-ubiquitination of uS10 was also observed, but di-ubiquitination remained the predominant pattern (miscicka2024ribosomalcollisionis pages 6-7). This shift in ubiquitination specificity underscores the impact of the K63R mutation on ZNF598's activity, as the enzyme typically synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the absence of this mutation (miscicka2024ribosomalcollisionis pages 4-...",

Some of these blastemas are capable of differentiation, including photoreceptor formation, but their morphology is frequently aberrant (Doddihala2024 pages 2-3). \n\nThe delay in blastema formation is attributed to disruptions in body axis patterning and mechanotransduction processes, with Pak1 acting as a functional integrator of \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways, as well as interacting with the Hippo/Yorkie pathway.

Ucp4A is involved in preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which contributes to maintaining redox homeostasis under heat stress conditions. This upregulation is part of a broader physiological adaptation in tropical embryos that enhances their heat tolerance by focusing on oxidative stress prevention rather than proteostasis. In contrast, canonical heat shock genes showed similar expression levels in both tropical and Vermont embryos, highlighting the unique role of oxidative stress response genes in tropical populations (mikucki2024heattoleranceoxidative pages 14-15, mikucki2024heattoleranceoxidative pages 13-14).\n\nAdditionally, tropical embryos exhibited higher expression of other genes involved in oxidative stress response, such as those encoding ROS-scavenging proteins, including Sod3.

    "response": "The nucleotide repeat (A4G)n within the RFC1 gene definitively does not result in the formation of H-DNA triplex structures. Studies have shown that nonpathogenic (A4G)60 repeats fail to form triplex DNA structures, as evidenced by minimal DNA polymerization stalling in vitro and the absence of replication fork stalling when these repeats are present in the lagging strand template. This conclusion is further supported by experimental data indicating that (A4G)10 repeats exhibit minimal interference with DNA replication processes, confirming their inability to form H-DNA triplexes (hisey2024pathogeniccanvas(aaggg)n pages 9-10).\n\nIn contrast, pathogenic (A2G3)n repeats are known to form H-DNA triplex structures that stall DNA replication in an orientation-dependent manner, contributing to genome instability and replication fork stalling in yeast and human cells (hisey2024pathogeniccanvas(aaggg)n pages 1-1, 9-10, 12-12).

CA1 is a protein involved in ion transport and water homeostasis and is identified as being underrepresented in IECs grown under in vitro conditions.

    "response": "Asp437 (D437) is essential for proton (H+) antiport in the serotonin transporter (SERT). Asp437 serves as a binding site for protons, with its protonation state being critical for H+-driven serotonin uptake. Mutations at Asp437 disrupt this process, underscoring its indispensable role in H+ antiport. This residue is conserved across other monoamine transporters, such as the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and dopamine transporter (DAT), further highlighting its functional importance (hellsberg2024identificationofthe pages 7-7; hellsberg2024identificationofthe pages 7-8).\n\nIn contrast, Ser438 (S438) is not required for H+ antiport, as evidenced by the retention of pH-dependent transport features in the S438A mutant.

The study demonstrated significant enrichment of tRNA-ValAAC, along with tRNA-ValCAC, in EVs, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01, indicating selective sorting of these tRNAs into EVs. In contrast, other tRNAs such as tRNA-ArgACG, tRNA-ArgCCG, tRNA-ProAGG, and tRNA-TyrGTA were more abundant within cells rather than in EVs, suggesting that these tRNAs are not preferentially incorporated into EVs (scheepbouwer2024fulllengthtrnaslacking pages 6-8).\n\nThe selective sorting mechanism for tRNAs into EVs appears to favor specific valine tRNAs, including tRNA-ValAAC, which are enriched in EVs compared to their functional, intact counterparts in cells.

Specifically, the combination of 4-thiouridine (4sU) with UVA stress induces the formation of DHX9-positive SGs, as does UVC irradiation. These SGs are distinct from classical SGs and are enriched in damaged intronic RNA. The relocation of DHX9 to the cytosol is a protective mechanism against RNA crosslinking damage and dsRNA stress. Confocal and live-cell imaging confirmed the presence of DHX9 in stress granules marked by G3BP1 under these conditions (zhou2024rnadamagecompartmentalization pages 1-2, 2-4, 8-8, 10-12).\n\nIn contrast, other stress treatments, such as etoposide, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), camptothecin, and hydroxyurea, do not trigger the formation of DHX9-positive SGs.

    ],
    "response": "Within the CTnano-cnt construct, the N55D mutation in the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein eliminates the protein's ability to bind to the TR stem-loop. This prevents the coat protein from repressing NLuc translation by blocking ribosome initiation at the NLuc start codon, resulting in increased NLuc protein production. Experimental data indicate that CTnano-cnt mRNA with the N55D mutation produces 6.8 times more NLuc protein compared to the wild-type coat protein construct, demonstrating the mutation's significant effect on relieving translational repression (dykeman2024designofa pages 6-6). \n\nHowever, the mutation also introduces a complication. The CTnano-cnt mRNA forms a more stable alternative hairpin structure, which reduces ribosome access to the NLuc start codon. This structural change leads to a 25-fold reduction in NLuc production compared to the wild-type construct under certain conditions (dykeman2024designofa pages 7-8).
