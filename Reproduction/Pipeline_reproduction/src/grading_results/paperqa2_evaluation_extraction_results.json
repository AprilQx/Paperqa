      "(A) No effect",
      "(B) Insufficient information to answer the question",
      "(C) Decrease",

    ],
    "response": "Bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned media (SCM) does not significantly alter the expression of the CD8\u03b1 receptor in cultured OT-1 T cells. In experiments where OT-1 T cells were exposed to SCM, the expression of CD8\u03b1 was measured and found to have a P-value of 0.7383, indicating no significant difference compared to unconditioned medium (UCM) (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 3-5). Additionally, when OT-1 T cells were cultured in SCM for 24 hours, there were no significant changes in the surface expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) or the CD8 co-receptor (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 5-6). \n\nWhile SCM maintains CD8 expression levels, a trend towards increased CD8\u03b1 expression was observed in T cells cultured in adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), suggesting that different microenvironments may have varying effects on T-cell receptor expression (kellner2024thetcellniche pages 5-6). Overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that SCM has no effect on CD8\u03b1 receptor expression in OT-...",
